# 🏷️ Release Guide

This guide explains how to create tags and releases for the 3dime-angular project using the automated GitHub Actions workflow.

## 🎯 Quick Start

Creating a new release is simple:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Actions** tab
3. Select **🏷️ Create Tag and Release** workflow
4. Click **Run workflow** button
5. Choose your options and click **Run workflow**

That's it! The workflow handles everything automatically.

## 📋 Workflow Options

### Version Bump Type

Choose how to increment the version number:

| Option | Current → New | When to Use |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| **patch** | 1.0.0 → 1.0.1 | Bug fixes, small changes, documentation updates |
| **minor** | 1.0.0 → 1.1.0 | New features that are backwards compatible |
| **major** | 1.0.0 → 2.0.0 | Breaking changes, major refactors |
| **custom** | Any → Custom | Specific version number (e.g., 2.5.0) |

### Custom Version

When you select **custom** as the version type, enter your desired version number in the format `major.minor.patch` (e.g., `1.2.3`).

- ✅ Valid: `1.0.0`, `2.5.3`, `10.0.1`
- ❌ Invalid: `v1.0.0`, `1.0`, `1.0.0-beta`

### Pre-release

Check this option if you're creating a pre-release version (alpha, beta, RC, etc.):

- ☑️ Checked: Marks the release as "Pre-release" on GitHub
- ☐ Unchecked: Creates a normal release

**Note**: Pre-release versions won't be marked as the "Latest" release.

### Include Build Artifacts

Check this option to build the project and attach the compiled files to the release:

- ☑️ Checked: Builds production version and uploads `dist/` as artifact
- ☐ Unchecked: Creates release without building (faster)

Build artifacts are retained for 90 days and can be downloaded from the Actions page.

## 🔄 Workflow Process

When you run the workflow, it performs these steps automatically:

### 1. Version Detection
```
Current version: 0.0.0 (from package.json or latest git tag)
```

### 2. Version Calculation
```
Patch:  0.0.0 → 0.0.1
Minor:  0.0.0 → 0.1.0
Major:  0.0.0 → 1.0.0
Custom: 0.0.0 → 2.5.0 (your choice)
```

### 3. Validation
- ✅ Checks if tag already exists
- ✅ Validates version format
- ✅ Ensures version is newer than current

### 4. Update Files
```bash
# Updates package.json with new version
npm version 1.2.3 --no-git-tag-version
```

### 5. Commit Changes
```bash
# Commits version bump
git commit -m "chore: bump version to 1.2.3"
```

### 6. Create Tag
```bash
# Creates annotated git tag
git tag -a v1.2.3 -m "Release 1.2.3"
```

### 7. Generate Changelog
Automatically categorizes commits since last release:
- 🚀 **Features**: Commits with `feat:` prefix
- 🐛 **Bug Fixes**: Commits with `fix:` prefix
- 📝 **Documentation**: Commits with `docs:` prefix
- 🔧 **Chores**: Commits with `chore:`, `refactor:`, etc.

**New in v2.0.3+**: The changelog now includes:
- ✅ Proper line breaks (no more `\n` characters)
- ✅ Clickable commit links for easy navigation
- ✅ Clean sections - empty categories are hidden
- ✅ Professional markdown formatting

### 8. Create GitHub Release
- Publishes release with auto-generated notes
- Links to tag
- Includes full changelog

### 9. Push Everything
```bash
# Pushes version bump and tag
git push origin HEAD:main
git push origin v1.2.3
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "Tag already exists" Error

**Problem**: You're trying to create a tag that already exists.

**Solution**: 
- Check existing tags: Go to Releases or run `git tag -l`
- Use a different version number
- If you need to update an existing release, delete the tag first:
  ```bash
  git tag -d v1.0.0
  git push origin :refs/tags/v1.0.0
  ```

### "Invalid version format" Error

**Problem**: Version number doesn't match semantic versioning format.

**Solution**: Use format `major.minor.patch` with numbers only:
- ✅ Valid: `1.0.0`, `2.5.3`
- ❌ Invalid: `v1.0.0`, `1.0`, `1.0.0-beta`

**Note**: Pre-release suffixes like `-beta` are not currently supported by the version calculator.

### Workflow Fails to Push

**Problem**: Permission denied when pushing to repository.

**Solution**: Ensure the workflow has write permissions:
1. Go to Settings → Actions → General
2. Under "Workflow permissions", select "Read and write permissions"
3. Re-run the workflow

### Build Artifacts Not Attached

**Problem**: Release doesn't have build artifacts attached.

**Solution**: 
- Make sure you checked "Include build artifacts" option
- Verify the build completed successfully in the workflow logs
- Check the Actions tab for the uploaded artifact

## 🎓 Best Practices

### Semantic Versioning

Follow semantic versioning principles:

- **MAJOR** (x.0.0): Breaking changes
  - API changes that break backwards compatibility
  - Major refactors
  - Dependency updates with breaking changes

- **MINOR** (0.x.0): New features
  - New functionality that's backwards compatible
  - New components or services
  - Significant improvements

- **PATCH** (0.0.x): Bug fixes
  - Bug fixes
  - Security patches
  - Minor tweaks and improvements

### Commit Messages

Use conventional commit format for better changelogs:

```bash
feat: add calendar converter component
fix: resolve profile image loading issue
docs: update installation instructions
chore: upgrade Angular to 20.3
refactor: reorganize service structure
style: format code with Prettier
test: add unit tests for auth service
perf: optimize bundle size
```

This helps the workflow categorize commits in the changelog.

**Example changelog output:**

```markdown

### Release Frequency

- **Patch releases**: As needed (bug fixes)
- **Minor releases**: Every 2-4 weeks (new features)
- **Major releases**: Every 3-6 months (breaking changes)

### Pre-release Testing

For major changes:
1. Create a pre-release version first (e.g., `2.0.0-beta.1`)
2. Test thoroughly
3. Get feedback from users
4. Create the final release (e.g., `2.0.0`)
