## Security Best Practices

### Secrets and API Keys

**NEVER commit secrets, API keys, or credentials to the repository.**

#### Environment Configuration

This project uses environment files for configuration:
- `src/environments/environment.ts` - Development configuration
- `src/environments/environment.prod.ts` - Production configuration

**Important:**
- These files are tracked in git and should NOT contain sensitive information
- Use environment variables or secure secret management for production deployments
- Example files are provided: `environment.example.ts` and `environment.prod.example.ts`

#### Firebase Configuration

If you need to add Firebase configuration in the future:

1. **For local development**: Use environment variables
2. **For production**: Use Firebase Hosting environment configuration or secure secret management
3. **Firebase API keys** can be restricted in the Firebase Console:
   - Go to Google Cloud Console → Credentials
   - Restrict the API key to specific domains
   - Enable only the APIs you need

**Note:** Firebase API keys for client-side apps are not secret but should be restricted to prevent abuse.

#### GitHub Secrets

For GitHub Actions and CI/CD:
- Store secrets in GitHub repository settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
- Never echo or log secrets in workflows
- Use minimal permissions for tokens

### Dependencies

- Keep dependencies up to date with `npm audit` and `npm update`
- Review security advisories regularly
- Use `npm audit fix` to automatically fix vulnerabilities when possible

### Code Security

- Avoid using `eval()` or similar dynamic code execution
- Sanitize user inputs
- Use TypeScript strict mode for type safety
- Follow Angular security best practices for XSS prevention

### Deployment Security

- Always use HTTPS in production
- Set appropriate CORS policies
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Enable security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.)
