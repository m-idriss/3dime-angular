# Security Alert Fix Summary

## What Was Done

### Problem
A Firebase API key was exposed in the repository, triggering GitHub's secret scanning alert.

### Solution
1. **Removed the exposed Firebase API key** from environment files
2. **Kept only necessary configuration** (`apiUrl`)
3. **Created example files** for future reference
4. **Enhanced security documentation**

## Files Changed

### Modified
- `src/environments/environment.ts` - Removed Firebase config, kept apiUrl
- `src/environments/environment.prod.ts` - Removed Firebase config, kept apiUrl
- `.gitignore` - Added security notes
- `README.md` - Added comprehensive security section
- `SECURITY.md` - Updated with detailed security guidelines

### Created
- `src/environments/environment.example.ts` - Template for developers
- `src/environments/environment.prod.example.ts` - Template for production
- `SECURITY_ALERT_RESOLUTION.md` - Step-by-step resolution guide

## Why It's Safe

The removed Firebase configuration was **never used**:
- Firebase SDK is not installed in `package.json`
- No Firebase initialization code exists
- Application only uses `environment.apiUrl`
- All services work correctly without Firebase config

## Verification

✅ Development build successful  
✅ Production build successful  
✅ Application functionality unchanged  
✅ No breaking changes

## What the Maintainer Should Do Next

1. **Rotate the exposed API key** in Google Cloud Console
   - Project: `image-to-ics`
   - Key: `AIzaSyDvQ4aCcWtSxGmTXefINTcsdb0O5zheYzE`
   
2. **Dismiss the GitHub security alert** after key rotation

3. **Review** `SECURITY_ALERT_RESOLUTION.md` for detailed steps
