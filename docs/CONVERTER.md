## Architecture

### Frontend (Angular)

**Component**: `src/app/components/converter/`

- Drag-and-drop file upload
- File validation (type, size)
- Progress indicators
- Error handling
- ICS file download

**Service**: `src/app/services/converter.ts`

- HTTP communication with Firebase function
- File-to-base64 conversion
- PDF-to-image conversion using PDF.js
- ICS file download helper

### Backend (Firebase Function)

**Function**: Implemented in the `3dime-api` repository at `src/proxies/converter.ts`

- Accepts POST requests with image/PDF data
- Calls OpenAI GPT-4 Vision API for event extraction
- Returns ICS content
- Handles errors and timeouts

## Usage

### User Workflow

1. Navigate to the converter section on the homepage
2. Sign in with Google (required for AI processing)
3. Upload one or more images or PDF files:
   - Drag and drop files into the upload area, OR
   - Click "Browse" to select files
4. Review the uploaded files
5. Click "Convert"
6. **Batch Processing (2+ files)**:
   - Watch real-time progress for each file
   - See status indicators: ⏳ Pending, 🔄 Processing, ✅ Success, ❌ Error
   - View extraction results per file (event count)
   - Retry failed files individually
7. **Review and edit extracted events:**
   - Click the edit button (✏️) on any event to modify its details
   - Edit event title, start/end times, location, and description
   - Click "Save" to apply changes or "Cancel" to discard
   - Click the delete button (🗑️) to remove unwanted events
8. Download the generated ICS file (combines all successful files)
9. Import the ICS file into your calendar application

### Event Editing Features

After AI extraction, you can edit any event before downloading:

#### Edit an Event
1. Click the **edit button (✏️)** on the event card
2. The event card expands into an edit form with the following fields:
   - **Event Title**: Edit the summary/name of the event
   - **Start Time**: Modify the start date and time (datetime-local picker)
   - **End Time**: Modify the end date and time (datetime-local picker)
   - **Location**: Add or change the event location (optional)
   - **Description**: Add or modify event notes (optional)
3. Click **Save (💾)** to apply your changes
4. Click **Cancel (✕)** to discard changes and return to view mode

#### Delete an Event
1. Click the **delete button (🗑️)** on any event card
2. The event is immediately removed from the list
3. The ICS file is automatically regenerated without the deleted event

**Note**: All changes are reflected in the generated ICS file when you click "Download Calendar". The ICS content is automatically regenerated whenever you save edits or delete events.

### Supported File Types

- **Images**: JPG, JPEG, PNG
- **Documents**: PDF (automatically converted to images before processing)
- **Max file size**: 10MB per file
- **Multiple files**: Yes, upload multiple files for batch processing

**Note**: PDF files are automatically converted to PNG images (one per page) using PDF.js before being sent to the AI for processing. This ensures compatibility with OpenAI's Vision API which only accepts image formats.

### Calendar Applications

## Technical Details

### Batch Processing Implementation

The batch processing feature intelligently handles multiple file uploads:

**Processing Modes**:
- **Single File Mode**: Original behavior - all files processed in one API call (faster for single files)
- **Batch Mode**: Sequential processing with progress tracking (activated for 2+ files)

**State Management**:
- `BatchFile` model tracks each file's status, progress, error messages, and results
- `BatchFileStatus` enum: `PENDING`, `PROCESSING`, `SUCCESS`, `ERROR`
- Signals are used for reactive state updates
- Computed values for batch statistics (total, success, error counts)

**Processing Flow**:
1. Files are initialized with `PENDING` status
2. Each file is processed sequentially (prevents API rate limits)
3. PDF files are converted to images before processing
4. Progress is updated at key stages (10%, 30%, 50%, 100%)
5. Results are combined from all successful files

**Error Handling**:
- Failed files don't block other files from processing
- Individual error messages stored per file
- Retry button available for failed files
- Summary message shows success/failure counts

**UI Features**:
- Batch progress bar showing overall completion
- Per-file status indicators with icons
- Events count display for successful files
- Retry buttons for failed files
- Glassmorphism styling consistent with app theme

### Event Editing Implementation

The event editing feature is implemented with inline editing:

**State Management**:
- Each `CalendarEvent` has an optional `isEditing` flag
- Signals are used for reactive state updates (`extractedEvents` signal)
- Only one event can be in edit mode at a time

**Edit Operations**:
- **Edit**: Sets the event's `isEditing` flag to `true`, expanding the card into a form
- **Save**: Updates the event data and sets `isEditing` to `false`, triggers ICS regeneration
- **Cancel**: Reverts to view mode without saving changes
- **Delete**: Removes the event from the array, triggers ICS regeneration

**ICS Regeneration**:
- When events are modified or deleted, the ICS content is automatically regenerated
- Uses the `dateToIcsFormat()` method to convert Date objects to ICS format (YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ)
- Generates RFC 5545 compliant ICS content with updated VEVENT entries
- Preserves all event properties (summary, start, end, location, description)

**Form Inputs**:
- Text inputs for title and location
- `datetime-local` inputs for start/end times (native browser datetime picker)
- Textarea for description
- All inputs use two-way binding with the event data

**UI/UX Features**:
- Inline editing directly on the event card
- Glassmorphism styling consistent with the app theme
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Visual feedback when in edit mode (highlighted border, expanded card)
- Icon buttons for edit/delete actions with hover effects
- Accessibility support with ARIA labels

### PDF Processing

PDF files are processed client-side before being sent to the API:

1. **Library**: Uses [PDF.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/) (Mozilla's open-source PDF renderer)
2. **Process**: Each PDF page is rendered to a canvas element at 1.5x scale for high quality
3. **Output**: Canvas is converted to JPEG data URL (92% quality, base64 encoded) for smaller file sizes
4. **Multi-page**: Each page becomes a separate image, processed individually by the AI
5. **Worker**: PDF.js worker is loaded from CDN (unpkg.com) for optimal performance

**Benefits of client-side conversion**:

- No server-side PDF libraries needed
- Reduces Firebase Function memory requirements
- Works with OpenAI Vision API (which only accepts images)
- Better privacy (PDF content processed in browser)

### AI Processing

The converter uses OpenAI's GPT-4 Vision model (`gpt-4o`) with:

- **Temperature**: 0.1 (low randomness for consistent output)
- **Max tokens**: 4096
- **Detail level**: High (for accurate OCR)

### Prompt Engineering

The system uses two prompts:

1. **System Prompt**: Defines the AI's role as a calendar extraction expert
2. **User Message**: Provides context (timezone, current date) and extraction instructions

### ICS Format

Generated ICS files include:

- `BEGIN:VCALENDAR` / `END:VCALENDAR` wrapper
- `VERSION:2.0` specification
- `PRODID` identifier
- For each event:
  - `UID`: Unique identifier
  - `DTSTAMP`: Timestamp of creation
  - `DTSTART`: Event start date/time
  - `DTEND`: Event end date/time
  - `SUMMARY`: Event title
  - `DESCRIPTION`: Event details (if available)
  - `LOCATION`: Event location (if available)
  - `TZID`: Timezone identifier (if applicable)

## Development

### Running Locally

1. Start the Angular development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. The converter is available at `http://localhost:4200/`

### Testing

The converter requires manual testing with real calendar images/PDFs since it depends on external AI services.

**Test files to try**:

- Calendar screenshots from phone/computer
- PDF event flyers
- Email screenshots with event details
- Social media event posts

### Troubleshooting

**Issue**: "Failed to convert PDF to images"

- PDF may be corrupted or password-protected
- PDF may use unsupported features
- Try converting the PDF to images manually first
- Check browser console for detailed error messages

**Issue**: "Failed to process images with AI"

- Check OpenAI API key is set correctly
- Verify API key has GPT-4 Vision access
- Check OpenAI account has sufficient credits

**Issue**: "No ICS content generated"

- Image quality may be too low
- Calendar information may not be clearly visible
- Try with a clearer image or higher resolution PDF

**Issue**: Files not uploading

- Check file size (max 10MB)
- Verify file type (JPG, PNG, or PDF only)
- For PDFs, ensure the file is valid and not corrupted

**Issue**: PDF.js worker fails to load

- Check Content Security Policy allows unpkg.com
- Verify network connection
- Check browser console for CSP violations

## Styling

The converter uses the app's global design system:

- Glassmorphism effects
- Space-themed colors
- Responsive layout
- Accessible controls

SCSS variables used:

- `--glass-bg`: Background with transparency
- `--glass-border`: Border color
- `--accent-color`: Primary action color
- `--text-primary`: Main text color
- `--text-secondary`: Secondary text color

## Security

- File validation on client-side (type, size)
- CORS protection on Firebase function
- Base64 encoding for file transmission
- No file storage (processing is stateless)
- OpenAI API key stored as Firebase secret

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Support for more file formats (Word, Excel)
- [x] **Batch processing with progress tracking** ✅ (Completed Oct 2025)
- [ ] Support for recurring events
- [ ] Multiple language support
- [ ] OCR fallback if AI extraction fails
