## Problem
The release workflow is failing at the "Install dependencies" step because it's configured to use npm commands, but this project uses Yarn as its package manager.

**Failed Job:** https://github.com/m-idriss/3dime-angular/actions/runs/21800346065/job/62894723719

**Error:**
```
npm error The `npm ci` command can only install with an existing package-lock.json or
npm error npm-shrinkwrap.json with lockfileVersion >= 1.
```

## Solution
Update `.github/workflows/release.yml` to use Yarn commands instead of npm:

### Required Changes:

1. **Line 49** - Change cache from npm to yarn:
   ```yaml
   cache: 'yarn'
   ```

2. **Line 52** - Replace npm ci with yarn install:
   ```yaml
   run: yarn install --frozen-lockfile
   ```

3. **Line 135** - Replace npm version with yarn version:
   ```yaml
   run: yarn version --new-version "$NEW_VERSION" --no-git-tag-version
   ```

4. **Line 141** - Update git add to include yarn.lock instead of package-lock.json:
   ```yaml
   git add package.json yarn.lock
   ```

5. **Line 146** - Replace npm run build with yarn build:
   ```yaml
   run: yarn build --configuration=production
   ```

## Additional Requirements
Ensure `yarn.lock` is committed to the repository.
